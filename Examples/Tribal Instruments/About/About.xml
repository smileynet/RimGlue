If the original author requests it, I will remove this update. 



This is my highly-unofficial "TribalInstruments" update, as it has not received an update for 1.3 (or one for 1.2, technically). 

Please note: all assembly functionality has been removed, and I have refactored the instruments according to Core/Royalty standards. Unfortunately for some, that means Royalty DLC is now required. Sorry! I don't have the C# chops yet to start fixing up .DLLs. Someday, maybe.

Not trying to step on anyone's toes here; I'll happily pull this mod if/when TribalInstruments is updated.

Adds:

Ranat
Ogolupe
Conga

All function as standard musical instruments (i.e. the Harp, Piano, etc.)
