<description>This mod is nearly identical to the previous version with the exception that this one fixes a very basic mistake I made when creating the old one. The only major benefit to this version is improved compatibility with its parent mod.

Adds one-tile versions of the Food Basket, Hamper and Tray Rack from LWM's Deep Storage.

Each storage stores the same thing that the two-tile version does and has exactly half the storage of the two-tile version. This means that the one-tile version stores the same number of stacks per cell but only covers one cell, therefore half. The one-tile variants also cost approximately half the resources. Where a max mass applies to the two-tile version the one-tile version can hold half the max mass.

Patches from the Deep Storage mod have been carried over where necessary to maintain compatibility.

!!! UPDATING AN EXISTING SAVE !!!
This re-release exists because I had to make a change to a very base-level piece of the mod. This mod is NOT backward compatible with the previous version. The only safe way to update to this version is to follow these instructions:

1) Load your save and remove all existing "Little Storage" storages from the map.
2) Save your game, remember to make a backup before you save.
3) Subscribe to this updated version and unsub the old version.
4) Load up your save and enjoy the game.

Have Fun!</description>
