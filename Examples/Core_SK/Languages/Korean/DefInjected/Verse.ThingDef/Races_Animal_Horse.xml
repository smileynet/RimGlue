  <Horse.label>말</Horse.label>
  <Horse.description>A large, peaceful herbivore widely known for its great speed and strength. 말s and humans have a history stretching back for millenia, so it is no surprise to see one. Unfortunately, all your colonists are absolutely inept at riding, otherwise it could craft a fitting steed.</Horse.description>

  <Horse_Wooly.label>털 많은 말</Horse_Wooly.label>
  <Horse_Wooly.description>A plump 말 covered in a thick fur fit for much colder climates. Oddly enough, 털 많은 말s have a throwback to their slower ancestors- actual toed feet; though much larger and further splayed, so as to act as a snowshoe. Odder yet, they seem to be omnivorous, with a set of large canines to boot.</Horse_Wooly.description>
