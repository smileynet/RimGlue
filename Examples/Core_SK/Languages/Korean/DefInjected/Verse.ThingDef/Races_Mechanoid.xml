  <Mech_Centipede.description>Centipedes are heavy combat Mechanoids that crawl on dozens of 주석y legs. They resemble a massive, fat grub in appearance. Their heavy armor and firepower makes them very effective against bunched-up static defenders. They are somewhat vulnerable to mobile hit-and-run tactics.</Mech_Centipede.description>
