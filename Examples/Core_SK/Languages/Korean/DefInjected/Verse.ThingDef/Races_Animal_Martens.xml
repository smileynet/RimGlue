  <Fishercat.label>족제비</Fishercat.label>
  <Fishercat.description>A small mammal of the Marten genus, the 족제비- or alternatively '족제비 Cat' is neither a fish eater nor a cat. Genetically closer to a weasel, 족제비s are long bodied but short lived. Considering their small size, 족제비s are known to be particularly vicious; hunting unusual prey such as porcupines and even young deer.\n\nDespite their cute appearance, 족제비s are very much wild and not likely to craft a good pet.</Fishercat.description>
