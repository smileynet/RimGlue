  <Meerkat.label>미어캣</Meerkat.label>
  <Meerkat.description>The 미어캣 or suricate (Suricata suricatta) is a small carnivoran belonging to the mongoose family (Herpestidae). It is the only member of the genus Suricata. A group of 미어캣s is called a "mob", "gang" or "clan". A 미어캣 clan often contains about 20 미어캣s, but some super-families have 50 or more members. In captivity, 미어캣s have an average life span of 12–14 years, and about half this in the wild.</Meerkat.description>
