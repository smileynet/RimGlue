  <Apparello_SheildGaurdian.description>An outdated single-person energy shield device, It's not known how the 노르망족 have gotten their hands on this level of technology or how they're able to manufacture them. It will attempt to stop any rapidly-moving projectile or energy attack that comes from a distance. It does nothing against melee attacks or shots from point-blank range. It prevents firing out as well. </Apparello_SheildGaurdian.description>
