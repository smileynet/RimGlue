  <!-- C5 INCANTATOR -->

  <Gun_PlasmaShotgun.label>C5 Incantator (샷건)</Gun_PlasmaShotgun.label>
  <Gun_PlasmaShotgun.description>Very rare 플라즈마 샷건. Deals high damage at short range; less effective at long range. Effective against armor, shields and biotic barriers. It is of human design but is only used by krogan, due to the fact that the kickback from a single shot has enough force to break a human's arm. Protected by Fabrication Rights Management (FRM) technology, this weapon is nearly impossible to reproduce and is prohibitively expensive.</Gun_PlasmaShotgun.description>
