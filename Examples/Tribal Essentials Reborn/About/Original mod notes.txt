This is an official 1.x update of Tribal Reborn B19

Based on RimRue's "Tribal Essentials" mod from A17 and Rainbeau Flambe from B18. All original credit goes to them!

THIS CAN BE STANDALONE!
THIS DOES [b]NOT[/b] REQUIRE ZARS CORE!
THIS DOES [b]NOT[/b] REQUIRE ZARS PRODUCTION SPOTS (But it helps)

[h1]Recommended Mods[/h1]
- ZARS Production Spots - Cleans up A17, B18, and B19 spot quirks and designation menu clutter.
- Research Pal -OR- Fluffy's Research Tab - Fixes visual research boxes.
- Tribal Raiders by Rainbeau Flambe - Fully activates the merged features with all the goodies
- Tribal Instruments by Hansenbansen
- Tribal Signal Fire by Fumblesneeze

[h1][b]PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS!!![/b][/h1]
Rainbeau (who last ported this mod) has stated they will not update in the near future. Since this is the only available Tribal Essentials update at the moment, I will attempt to keep it as close as possible to the original. Any and all ZARS planning for it has been dropped as promised, it is a standalone mod. There are a few 1.0 quirks that will be progressively addressed and fixed as needed.

[h1][b]1.0 Compatiblity Fixes:[/b][/h1]
- The defs are almost all backward compatible with B18 Tribal Essentials and B19 Tribal Reborn.
- Rainbeau Flambe's [RF] Tribal Raiders 1.0 has been partially merged and partially active in a lightweight capacity. Subscribing to the mod will fully activate all its features.
- Stacking with ZARS Production Spots will override all spots and enable Art Spot to make rugs
- All crafting spots are deprecated (they exist only for Tribalism itself), use ZARS Production Spots if wanting to use other mods with Tribalism.

[h1][b]B19 Compatiblity Fixes:[/b][/h1]
- The only bare-bone def rename was "FloorWood6" -&gt; "FloorWoodBarn"
- DoubleSleepingSpot was removed as it is now in B19.
- BedRolls were removed as they are now in B19.
- PatchedLeather was removed as it is now in B19. New version crafted at Tailor Spot.
- Great Bow requires only Recurve Bow research. Craft at Crafting Spot, or Smithy as normal.
- Pila requires Tribal Warfare before being able to craft at Crafting Spot.
- Psycoid Tea (visually) renamed to Tribal Psycoid Tea to avoid confusion with Psycite Tea.
- All texture file naming renamed from ('front', 'back', 'side') to ('south', 'north', 'east').
- Smoked Meat is now a Meal. Originally was Raw Meat with now unsupported exclusion tags.
- Basic Traps patch has been changed after finding a rename bug.
- Harmony DLL functions have been kept as it seems to still be stable, at least on load.
- Researching Spot does not require any research to make custom zero-start scenarios work.
- Woven Cloak and Hat can be made from Leather now too.
- Some Primitive Floors recipe costs for flooring will be rebalanced to make more sense.

[h1][b]Known Issues:[/b][/h1]
- Some research boxes are not positioned correctly. Recommended to use Research Pal or Fluffy's Research Tab
- (Confirmed) Few recipes might not make sense for their ingredients.
- (Unconfirmed) Few recipes might not be even craftable due to me derping on the new xml tags.

[h1]- ORIGINAL TEXT (Edited) -[/h1]
This mod adds new tribal items for those players who want to play a tribal scenario and who don't want to rush into research. It includes joy items, production spots for butchering, brewing, art, tailoring, stonecutting and researching, a smokepit, a stone oven, psychoid tea, cooked eggs, popcorn, and art, apparel, walls and flooring.

Apparel:
- Woven Hats and Cloaks (made from dried grass or pounded bark)
- Muffalo Headdress (an impressive hat which yields a small Social boost)
- Tribal Helmet (a wooden tribal helmet; requires "Smithing" research)
- Tribal Armor (a tough hide coat with wooden slat armor; requires "Smithing" research)

Furniture:
- Storage Box (a place to hide ugly items or to protect perishable items from the elements)

Items:
- Cooked eggs (since you can't use eggs in pemmican)
- Crafting Basket (a tribal version of the toolchest, made from hay, which boosts production speed)
- Large and Small Rugs
- Large and Small Totems
- Popcorn (gives joy, but not much nutrition)
- Psychoid Tea (a social drug that can also help fight disease)
- Smoked meat (preserved meat, which can be eaten "as is" or made into pemmican)
- Urns and Decorative Pots

Joy Objects:
- Three Stones Game (a tribal version of chess)
- Tribal Lore Fire (a place for tribals to gather, share stories, and gain a small Social skill boost)

Production:
- Art, Brewing, Butchering, Researching, Stonechipping and Tailoring Spots
- Smokepit (a small fire used to make smoked meat)
- Stone Oven (a primitive oven, better than a campfire for cooking food)

Security:
- Earthen Mounds (more protection than rock chunks, but not as much as sandbags)
- Pitfall Trap (a deep pit with sharp spikes; requires "Basic Traps" research)

Walls and Floors:
- Barn Board Floor (uses less wood to build)
- Log Walls (like wood walls, but with a log texture)
- Rough Paving (uses less stone to build)
- Random Paving (requires "Stonecutting" research)
