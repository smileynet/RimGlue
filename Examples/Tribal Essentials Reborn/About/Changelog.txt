1.0.0 - 9/9/2021 - downloaded 1.2 version from Workshop

removed old "Tribal Raiders" pieces, pawnkind, faction, dependency (unneeded, tribal raider factions now exist in vanilla, and I'm not up to fixing the DLL anyway) 

removed Harmony dependency (separate now) - I'm not sure it's still needed as I don't run without it anyway - pretty sure it was only for the TR integration as the rest seem to be straight-forward defs

Cleaned out older unused defs and texture assets, cleaned up folder structure

removed smoked meat and smokepit - use Zal's Smoked Meat, patches included for smoked fish and fungus if mods/DLC is in use

lowered filth % on barn wood floor

May need to refactor the researchprojects etc

remove tribal psychoid tea?
