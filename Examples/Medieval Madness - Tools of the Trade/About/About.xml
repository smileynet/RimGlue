(v1.2.24/08/20)
Medieval Madness: Tools of the Trade is a part of planned Medieval Madness modpack that provides access to 50+ melee and ranged weapons of medieval era for both combat and trade. Without upcoming factions mod, only melee pirates and outlanders will have access to new weapons, as tribes are not technologically developed enough to use advanced forging techniques.
