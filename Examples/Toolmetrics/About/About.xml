Original description

This mod adds 41 weapon-slot hand tools aimed at non-combat usage for pawns to equip. 


Goals:

✔ Offer meaningful choices to the equipment system by giving pawns desirable non-combat options that compete for space and resources with combat options

✔ Provide more meaning to certain pre-existing mechanics, such as equipment racks, smithing, crafting spots and component tables.

✔ Allow for deeper end games with fewer pawns by increasing the ability of specialists pawns with sufficient resources as support.

✔ Makes establishing multiple colonies easier and more viable.


Implementation:

* New weapons category, &amp;quot;Tools&amp;quot;, that are equippable by pawns.

* 41 new tools, each of which provides benefits to a specific type of role within the colony, such as tailoring or plant cutting.

* Tools are balanced as melee weapons.

* Tools are tiered by technologies, and available to craft from smithing, tailoring, crafting spots, component benches, or machining tables.

* Raiders will occasionally spawn with tools, especially in low value raids or disorganized raiding parties. The majority of raiders will keep proper weapons.

* Tools are largely makeable from any available stuff, as opposed to specific recipes.

[b]Announcement[/b]

Given my current work schedule and lack of motivation I decided I am unable to continue to work on Rimworld mods and will be making an exit in the mod scene indefinetely.

I hereby will be allowing my work to be continued and published by other. I ask only for credit. This will apply to all my current workshop.
